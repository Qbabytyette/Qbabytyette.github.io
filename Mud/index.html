        From my understanding the "ball of mud" theory is a saying used to describe the mess of code that makes no sence.
         However in the words of the authors, “People build big balls of mud because they work. In many domains, they are the only things that have been shown to work.”
         seems like programmers always encounter balls of mud through out theor work and they are only instructed to keep the program working.
         The people working on the muddy ball always has an advantage over otherswhich is this, the program is running which means it has people using it
         which also means te users will give feedback. this feed back will tell the programmer exactly what to look for to fix or change.

         Personally i think the big ballof mud is something that should never have to happen. now with that being said i think with the time constraint
         and the amount of work that needs to be done on a project, putting a semiworking program out to meet deadlines is acceptable. since the program can still be
         altered and fixed, and updated.
