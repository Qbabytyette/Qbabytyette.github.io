          I think its interesting that match making dating sites were based on a matchmaking program written on a computer in the 1960s.
          I didn't kniw Michael Jackson had anything to do with writing code. Requirements will change and be misunderstood.
          Build and fix model is to build the program and continue to work on it until the customer is satisfied. Then use the program until 
          you find other problems and fix those. Working on a program or any project on an impossibly short deadline causes things to get messed up.
          Every developer knows that the program code is going to fail and needs to be refactored before the product even hits market.
          The silver bullet is a lie. There cant be any changes to programming until someone can deal with the pain.
