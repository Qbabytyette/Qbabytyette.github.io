      <p>The Chandler project was expencive to start with;
         being that they had to spend so much money on licensing and permissions alone.
         "Constraints are key to building a great product.  
         They're what makes creativity happen.  
         If someone said you have all the money in the world to build whatever you want, it would probably never be released.  
         Give me just a month!" - Jason Fried.
         Chandler stratedout as a free program for consumers to use.
         i didnt realize chandler was built using the python language.
         Problems are always different. You bever have to deal with the exact same problem before.
          fixing these problems are never thesame as fixing previous issues.
          Game develpoers have the hardest time with their products for the simple reason that they are not allowed to put out a broken game. 
          They have to go with a time comstraint more trying than other developers and programmers do.
