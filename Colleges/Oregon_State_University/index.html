<h3>Computer Graphics and Visualization</h3>
<p>Overview
    The Computer Graphics and Visualization group consists of researchers in image processing, computer graphics, visualization, visual analytics, GPU programming, simulation, and geometry processing. 
    The primary goals of this group are the analysis, synthesis, understanding, and manipulation of visual data such as images, video sequences, and 3D geometric content.
    
    Application areas span a broad range from art entertainment, to science and engineering, and to biology and medicine. The group is actively engaged in image and video editing and enhancement, special effects, 3D interactive content generation, pattern recognition and object recognition. This research cluster includes the researchers from the Graphics & Image Technologies Laboratory as well as overlapping with researchers in the Data Science, Theoretical Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence groups.</p>
